This program implements a trapezoidal approximation method for
determining the area under a curve (also found in Section 3.2 of the
book). In this assignment you will be implementing a pthread version of
this approximation method.

In the sample files provided a serial implemententation is
provided. You can execute this with multiple threads but the
approximation will be off because of accessing a shared variable
incorrectly. This assigned asks you to protect this variable in two
different ways:

 1. Busy-Wait
 2. Mutex

These protections will add overhead to the program and the point of
this assigment is to observe the difference.
