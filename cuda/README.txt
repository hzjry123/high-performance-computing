Part 1: Implement the Hillis/Steel parallel scan algorithm using a
double buffered array described. Assume that the array is always
exactly 1024 elements. This assumption is baked into the skeleton
code, implement your code in par_scan kernel function.

Part 2: Verify that your function works for any size array upto
1024. What happens if you exceed 1024? Try it out! Describe what
happens, why?

Part 3: Using par_scan as a building block propose a solution for
parallelizing arbitrarily large arrays. Write the psuedo-code for this
proposed solution.
